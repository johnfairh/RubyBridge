Embed Ruby in Swift: load Gems, run Ruby scripts, get results.

RubyBridge is a framework built on the Ruby C API that lets Swift programs
running on macOS or Linux painlessly and safely run and interact with Ruby
programs.  It's easy to pass Swift datatypes into Ruby and turn Ruby objects
back into Swift types.

This project is [young](https://johnfairh.github.io/RubyBridge/todo.html):
biggest missing features right now are collection types and calling Swift code
from Ruby.  The eventual goal is to allow implementation of Ruby classes in
Swift to enable Ruby as a sandboxed DSL/scripting language for Swift applications.

See [CRuby](https://github.com/johnfairh/CRuby) if you are looking for a
low-level Ruby C API wrapper.

## Examples

A couple of examples:

### Services

[Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) is a code highlighter.  In Ruby:
```ruby
require 'rouge'
html = Rouge.highlight("let a = 3", "swift", "html")
puts(html)
```

In Swift 4 with similar [lack of] error checking:
```swift
import RubyBridge

try! Ruby.require("rouge")
let html = try! Ruby.get("Rouge").call("highlight", args: ["let a = 3", "swift", "html"])
print(html)
```

In future Swift:
```swift
import RubyBridge

try! Ruby.require("rouge")
let html = Ruby.Rouge!.highlight("let a = 3", "swift", "html")!
print(html)
```

### Objects

```swift
// Create an object.  Use keyword arguments with initializer
let student = RbObject(ofClass: "Academy::Student", kwArgs: [("name", "barney")])!

// Acess an attribute
print("Name is \(student.get("name"))"

// Fix their name by poking an ivar
try! student.setInstanceVar("@name", newValue: "Barney")

// Get a Swift version of `:reading`
let readingSubject = RbSymbol("reading")

// Call a method with mixed Swift data types
try! student.call("add_score", args: [readingSubject, 30])
try! student.call("add_score", args: [readingSubject, 35])

// Get a result as floating point
let avgScoreObj = try! student.call("mean_score_for_subject", args: [readingSubject])
let avgScore = Double(avgScoreObj)!
print("Mean score is \(avgScore)")
```

## Documentation

* [User guide](https://johnfairh.github.io/RubyBridge/user-guide.html).
* [API documentation](https://johnfairh.github.io/RubyBridge).
* [Docset for Dash](https://johnfairh.github.io/RubyBridge/docsets/RubyBridge.tgz).

## Requirements

* Swift 4 or later, from swift.org or Xcode 9.2+.
* macOS (tested on 10.13.3) or Linux (tested on Ubuntu Xenial/16.04 on x86_64) with Clang 6+.
* Ruby 2.0 or later including development files:
  * For macOS, this comes with Xcode.
  * For Linux you may need to install a -dev package depending on how your Ruby
    is installed.

## Installation

For macOS, if you are happy to use the system Ruby then you just need to include
the RubyBridge framework as a dependency.  If you are building on Linux or want
to use a different Ruby then you also need to configure CRuby.

RubyBridge requires 'original' MRI/CRuby Ruby - no JRuby/Rubinius/etc.

### Getting the framework

Carthage for macOS:
```
github "johnfairh/RubyBridge"
```

Swift package manager for macOS or Linux:
```
.package(url: "https://github.com/johnfairh/RubyBridge", from: "0.1.0")
```

CocoaPods soon&trade;.

### Configuring CRuby

CRuby is the glue between RubyBridge and your Ruby installation.  It is a
[separate github project](https://github.com/johnfairh/CRuby) but RubyBridge
includes it as submodule so you do not install or require it separately.

By default it points to the macOS system Ruby.  Follow the [CRuby usage
instructions](https://github.com/johnfairh/CRuby/README.md#usage) to change
this.  For example on Linux using [Brightbox Ruby](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/ruby/ubuntu/)
2.5:
```shell
sudo apt-get install ruby2.5 ruby2.5-dev pkg-config
mkdir MyProject
swift package init
vi Package.swift    # add RubyBridge as a dependency (NOT CRuby)
echo "import RubyBridge; print(Ruby.versionDescription)" > Sources/MyProject/MyProject.swift
swift package edit CRuby
Packages/CRuby/cfg-cruby --mode pkg-config --name ruby-2.5
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(pwd)/Packages/CRuby:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH swift run
```
