## General Usage

The Ruby VM is initialized when you first try to use it and shut down when the
process ends.  Load Ruby code using `RbGateway.load(filename:wrap:)` or
`RbGateway.require(filename:)`.  Or just run some Ruby code and get the result
using `RbGateway.eval(ruby:)`.  There already is a global instance of `RbGateway`
called `Ruby` so the code looks like:

```swift
import RubyGateway

do {
    let result = try Ruby.eval(ruby: "'a' * 4")
    print(result)
} catch {
}
```

Create objects using `RbObject.init(ofClass:args:kwArgs:)`.  Pass Swift types
or `RbObject`s to the `args` parameter.

Use `RbObjectAccess.call(_:args:kwArgs:)` to call methods on the object.  See
`RbObjectAccess` for more object operations and variations on `call` including
passing Swift code as a block.  Again pass Swift types or `RbObject`s in the
`args` parameter.

Use optional initializers to convert from `RbObject`s back to Swift types, or
implicitly/explicitly access `RbObject.description` if you just want `String`.

```swift
import RubyGateway

do {
    try Ruby.require(filename: "academy")
    let student = try RbObject(ofClass: "Academy::Student",
                               kwArgs: [("name", "Betty")])
    if let bettyGpa = try Double(student.get("gpa")) {
        processScore(gpa: bettyGpa)
    }
} catch {
}
```

## How to ...

A few Ruby-ish tasks.  These are more long-winded in Swift.  The idea here
though is not to let you write Ruby using Swift: use Ruby to do that!  But
rather to provide a layer that lets you bridge between Ruby and Swift code,
which will sometimes require driving the Ruby code in these ways.

### Pass a symbol as an argument

Use `RbSymbol`.  Ruby:
```ruby
res = obj.meth(:value)
```
RubyGateway:
```swift
let res = try obj.call("meth", args: [RbSymbol("value")])
```

### Pass a method as a block

Use `RbProc` and `RbSymbol`.  Ruby:
```ruby
res = arr.each(&:downcase)
```
RubyGateway:
```swift
let res = try arr.call("each", block: RbProc(object: RbSymbol("downcase")))
```

### Pass Swift code as a block

Use an `RbObjectAccess.call(...)` variant with a `blockCall` argument.  Ruby:
```ruby
obj.meth { |x| puts(x) }
```
RubyGateway:
```swift
try obj.call("meth") { args in
    print(args[0])
    return .nilObject
}
```
If the method causes the Ruby object to capture the block as a proc then you
have to tell RubyGateway:
```swift
try obj.call("meth", blockRetention: .self) { args in
    print(args[0])
    return .nilObject
}
```

### Use 'break' in a Swift block

Throw an `RbBreak`.  Ruby:
```ruby
result = array.each do |item|
   break item if f(item)
end
```
RubyGateway:
```swift
result = try array.call("each") { args in
    if f(args[0]) {
        throw RbBreak(with: args[0])
    }
    return .nilObject
}
```

### Create a Proc with Swift code

Use `RbObject.init(blockCall:)`.  Ruby:
```ruby
myProc = proc { |a, b| a + b }
```
RubyGateway:
```swift
myProc = RbObject() { args in
    return args[0] + args[1]
}
```
You must not let the `RbObject` expire while Ruby is holding on to the proc
object or the program will crash.  For example if you pass `myProc` to a
method of a Ruby object that captures the proc for later use, then you must
not let that Swift value go out of scope until the Ruby object has died or
otherwise guarantees never to invoke the proc.

### Create a lambda with Swift code

You can't: there's not much value and the API doesn't provide the argument
policing.  If you really need to then this kind of thing should get you
started:
```swift
let myLambda = try Ruby.call("lambda", blockRetention: .returned) { args in
                   print("I got \(args.count) args!")
                   return .nilObject
               }
```

### Access class variables

Use `RbObjectAccess.getClassVar(_:)` **on the class**: RubyGateway goes like the
Ruby API not Ruby as written.  Ruby:
```ruby
class MyClass
  @@count = 0
  def initialize
    @@count += 1
  end
end
```
RubyGateway:
```swift
let myClass = try Ruby.getClass("MyClass")
let count = try myClass.getClassVar("@@count")
```

### Run finalizers before process exit

If you want to stop using Ruby and get on with something else, and
never come back to Ruby in the process, use `RbGateway.cleanup()`.

## Error Handling

RubyGateway is very explicit about failure points.  Any Ruby method call can
raise an exception instead of terminating normally and this is reflected in the
throwable nature of most of the interesting RubyGateway methods.

Normally when writing Ruby scripts one doesn't care about this and just lets
the program crash, which happens very rarely after the debugging phase.  If you
are using RubyGateway though, there is presumably a lot more happening for you
and your users than the Ruby stuff -- otherwise you'd be writing Ruby, not
Swift.  I feel it does not make sense for a subsystem like this to decide how to
handle errors, so RubyGateway propagates all errors ([except when it doesn't]
(#caveats-and-gotchas)).

And `try!` is always available for quick don't-care-about-errors environments.

### Errors + Exceptions

All errors thrown are `RbError` which is an enum of various interface errors
detected by RubyGateway and one case `RbError.rubyException` that covers all
Ruby exceptions.

RubyGateway remembers the last few `RbError`s that were generated and stores
them in the publicly available `RbError.history`.

### `nil` failures

Converting Ruby values to Swift types works differently: it happens using
failable initializers such as `String.init(_:)`.  These can fail for a variety
of reasons.  When they do, RubyGateway still internally generates an `RbError`
and stores a copy in `RbError.history` even though it is not thrown.  This
means you can diagnose why a conversion failed:

```swift
guard let score = Float(scoreObj) else {
    print("Failed to get score back from Ruby: \(RbError.history.mostRecent)")
    return
}
```

### Failable Adapter

`RbFailableAccess` is a non-throwing adapter for `RbObject` and `RbGateway` that
returns `nil` when there is an error.  All it does is `try?` the
corresponding throwing method, meaning that the details of the failure are
available in `RbError.history`.

This is a steal of rough approach (the name is my fault) from the Python DML
sandbox with an eye to adding direct member lookup/callable to RubyGateway --
Swift subscripts can't throw.

I'm not sure this is better than just writing `try?` which at least makes it
very difficult for readers to ignore the possibility of errors.

## Concurrency

*more details to understand*

Do not access RubyGateway APIs from more than one thread ever.

## Caveats and Gotchas

### Crashiness

Certain `RbObject` methods forward to Ruby calls and crash (`fatalError()`)
if Ruby fails / the object doesn't support the method.  It's up to you to be
sure the Ruby objects you're dealing with are of the right type.  See
`RbObject` for more information on which these methods are.

### Swift closure retention

If you pass a Swift closure to a method as a block/proc/lambda that is used
by Ruby after that method finishes -- ie. *not* the normal `#each`-type use --
then you need to understand `RbBlockRetention`.

The reason for all this is that calling Swift code from Ruby requires an
intermediate Swift object, and RubyGateway needs to tie the lifetime of that
Swift object to something else in the Swift world.

### Ruby code safety

Running arbitrary Ruby code is a bad idea unless the process itself is
sandboxed: there are no restrictions on what the Ruby VM can do including
call `exit!`.

## Using the CRuby API

The [CRuby](https://github.com/johnfairh/CRuby) package provides access to as
much of the `libruby` API as makes it through the importer.  You can use this
in conjunction with RubyGateway to access more of the API than RubyGateway itself
provides.

Each `RbObject` wraps one `VALUE` keeping it safe from garbage collection.  You
can access that `VALUE` using `RbObject.withRubyValue(call:)`.

RubyGateway caches intern'ed Ruby strings - you can access the cache using
`RbGateway.getID(for:)`.

Note that when you call the Ruby API and Ruby raises an exception, the process
immediately crashes unless you are running inside `rb_protect()` or equivalent.
