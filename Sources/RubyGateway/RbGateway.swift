import CRuby
import RubyGatewayHelpers

/// Provides information about the Ruby VM, some control over how code is run,
/// and services to access various kinds of Ruby objects from the top level.
///
/// You cannot instantiate this type.  Instead RubyGateway exports a public
/// instance `Ruby`.  Among other things this permits dynamic member lookup
/// and callable-style programming in Swift 5.
///
/// The Ruby VM is initialized when the object is first accessed and is
/// automatically stopped when the process ends.  The VM can be manually shut
/// down before process exit by calling `RbGateway.cleanup()` but once this has
/// been done the VM cannot be restarted and subsequent calls to RubyGateway
/// services will fail.
///
/// The loadpath (where `require` looks) is set to the `lib/ruby` directories
/// adjacent to the `libruby` the program is linked against and `$RUBYLIB`.
/// RubyGems are enabled.
///
/// ## Accessing Ruby objects
///
/// The class inherits from `RbObjectAccess` which lets you look up constants
/// or call functions as you would at the top level of a Ruby script, for example:
/// ```swift
/// import RubyGateway
///
/// print("Ruby version is \(Ruby.version)")
///
/// do {
///    try Ruby.require("rouge")
///    let html = try Ruby.get("Rouge").call("highlight", args: ["let a = 1", "swift", "html"])
/// } catch {
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Or with Swift 5 dynamic member lookup & callable:
/// ```swift
/// let html = Ruby.Rouge!.highlight("let a = 1", "swift", "html")!
/// ```
///
/// If you just want to create a Ruby object of some class, see
/// `RbObject.init(ofClass:args:kwArgs:)`.
